# vue-component-typescript-webpack-vs2015-example

This is a part of me learning the ropes with all the above technologies, as I am new to the client side programming.

The solution is my extraction of the example given in https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component/tree/master/example.

There are several things I needed to configure: 
- Update the package versions to the latest ones, as of 14-03-2017.
- Add source map to typescript.
- VS projects - how to build, how to disable TS, etc, as I am willing to rely on the VSCode rather than get into the somewhat raw support in VS2015.

The front end code in located in the 'FrontEnd' folder.
